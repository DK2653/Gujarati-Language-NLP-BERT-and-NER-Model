# Gujarati-Language-NLP-BERT-and-NER-Model
Advancements in NLP have transformed many languages, but regional languages like Gujarati lack adequate models. This project addresses this gap by developing specialized NLP tools, including a BERT model and NER system, tailored for Gujarati to enhance text processing and understanding

Project Overview
In this project, we focus on creating a robust BERT model and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system tailored for Gujarati. The goal is to improve text processing capabilities and facilitate more effective interactions with Gujarati language data. By leveraging the power of BERT and fine-tuning it for Gujarati, along with implementing an NER system, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of language processing tasks.

Key Components
Gujarati BERT Model: A pre-trained BERT model adapted for the Gujarati language to support various NLP tasks.
NER System: A Named Entity Recognition system designed to identify and categorize entities within Gujarati text.
Why Gujarati?
Gujarati, a prominent regional language spoken by millions, is often underrepresented in the realm of NLP resources. This project addresses the need for more inclusive and diverse language models that can support a wider range of languages, thereby empowering research and application development in underrepresented linguistic regions.

Features
Pre-trained BERT Model: Utilizes the latest advancements in language representation to enhance understanding of Gujarati text.
Named Entity Recognition: Identifies and categorizes entities such as people, organizations, and locations in Gujarati text.
